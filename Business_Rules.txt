Business rules help define the constraints, requirements, and logic governing the behaviour of your fleet management system. 

1. Vehicle Creation:
   - Rule: Every new vehicle must be associated with a branch, a fleet type, an ownership category, a project, a vehicle status, and a vehicle type.
   - Reasoning: Ensures that each vehicle is properly categorized and affiliated with essential attributes.

2. Driver Assignment:
   - Rule: A driver can be assigned to only one vehicle at a time.
   - Reasoning: Avoids situations where a driver is simultaneously assigned to multiple vehicles, ensuring clarity and accountability.

3. Vehicle Status Update:
   - Rule: Only authorized personnel can update the status of a vehicle.
   - Reasoning: Ensures that status updates are performed by individuals with the necessary authority, maintaining data integrity.

4. Vehicle Information Update:
   - Rule: Changes to critical vehicle information (e.g., ownership category or vehicle type) must be logged and approved.
   - Reasoning: Ensures that updates to essential vehicle details are tracked and subject to authorization, preventing unauthorized modifications.

5. Project Association:
   - Rule: A vehicle can be associated with multiple projects over time, but only one project at a time.
   - Reasoning: Facilitates the tracking of a vehicle's involvement in different projects while avoiding simultaneous participation in multiple projects.

6. View Vehicle Details:
   - Rule: Users can view vehicle details based on their role and permissions.
   - Reasoning: Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized personnel, preserving data security and privacy.

7. Validation of Input:
   - Rule: Input data (e.g., vehicle details, driver information) must be validated for accuracy and completeness.
   - Reasoning: Prevents errors and inaccuracies in the system by ensuring that entered data meets specified criteria.

8. Audit Trail for Updates:
   - Rule: Maintain an audit trail for updates to vehicle-related information, including who made the update and when.
   - Reasoning: Facilitates transparency and accountability, allowing for tracking changes made to critical data over time.

9. Exception Handling:
   - Rule: Implement error-handling mechanisms to manage unexpected scenarios, providing appropriate feedback to users.
   - Reasoning: Ensures system robustness and user-friendliness by addressing unexpected situations gracefully.

10. Authorization Levels:
    - Rule: Different authorization levels exist for system users based on their roles (e.g., admin, manager, regular user).
    - Reasoning: Enforces a hierarchy of access permissions, ensuring that users have appropriate access to system functionalities based on their roles.

These business rules help maintain the integrity, security, and efficiency of the fleet management system, ensuring that it operates in accordance with specified requirements and user expectations.
